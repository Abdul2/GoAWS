<h3> Simple GO programme to display ec2 attributes </h3>


The programme uses GO sdk to query AWS account and then renders html table to display the results.
 
 I use it at work when i am asked to provide a summary of deployed ec2s.

<h3> To run </h3>

- Install GO 

- go get the AWS sdk 

- down load and run

- update HTTML to reflect your organisation

You must have your AWS credentials (access keys) present in your credentials file (refer to AWS documentations)

<h3> output</h3>
